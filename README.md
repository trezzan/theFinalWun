### challenge 1.1
I searched around the shodan sites with the tag for axis. After going through about 10 or so trying the default login creds of admin and pass. This was my last failed attempt. I started even using 'password, admin, and pass'.

### challenge2.2
Shodan filtering brought me 4 results. Oddly enough, when adding the network identifier it wouldn't work. I tried asn: and networkid: but I just got no results

## Part 2
I prefer to not use Tails or browse the dark markets. I please contact Jon Homer as he advised me to avoid illegal content. Jonathan.Homer@hq.dhs.gov
I have done a research project on Tails and onion networks during the first quarter and am happy to share my powerpoint with you for points.
